# TelecomChurn-Case-Study
> In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition. For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to **predict which customers are at high risk of churn**. In this project, you will analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn.

## General Information
-  build a machine learning model that is able to predict churning customers based on the features provided for their usage.

## Conclusions
- Based on the analysis conducted using various machine learning techniques, several factors were identified as significant predictors of churn. These factors include:

    - Incoming Minutes of usage in August, Roaming Calls, Network Calls, Tenure, Roaming, Average Revenue per User

- Based on these findings, here are some strategies to manage customer churn effectively:

    - Engaging Campaigns, Promoting 3G Usage, Focus on New Customers

- By implementing these strategies, the telecom company can enhance customer satisfaction, reduce churn rate, and foster long-term customer loyalty.
